## Usage

This component is used to display a flame graph.

It requires that the `data` prop is an array of objects with the following shape:

```ts
export type FlameGraphDataItem = {
  id: string
  name: string
  start_value: number
  end_value: number
  parent_id?: string
  [key: string]: any
}
```

## Gotchas

### Flame Graph data violations

There are 3 ways in which the data might be violated - 1. The items might be `too short`, `too long` or there might be `overlap`.

The parent's start and end value should always sum up to the combination of the child's start and end time.
However, if the children's end_value is before the parent's end_value it would result in being `too short`.
However, if the children's end_value is greater the parent's end_value it would result in being `too long`.
However, if there is an overlap between the item's start_value and end_value, it would result in an `overlap`.

<ComponentPreview
  name="flame-graph-data-violations"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
/>

### What happens when there are >1 or no "root processes".

We will give an error.

<ComponentPreview
  name="flame-graph-no-root"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
/>

<ComponentPreview
  name="flame-graph-multiple-root"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
/>

### What happens when there are processes without any valid parent_id

We would filter the data out, with a console.warn message.

<ComponentPreview
  name="flame-graph-orphan-children"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
/>
